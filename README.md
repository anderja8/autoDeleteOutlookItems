# autoDeleteOutlookItems
A simple Visual Basic script to automatically delete emails from Outlook coming from a specific sender or with a specific subject and more than 12 hours old

At my old job, I had a very limited amount of email storage, but was constantly bombarded by daily emails with
attachments over 1 mb in size. I ran this sub daily to flush the old emails from my inbox and deleted items folder.
Every time I got added to a new email chain, I would add that email to the if condition in the code.
