# autoDeleteOutlookItems
A simple Visual Basic script to automatically delete emails from Outlook coming from a specific sender or with a specific subject and more than 12 hours old

At my old job, I had a very limited amount of email storage, but was constantly bombarded by daily emails with
attachments over 1 mb in size. I ran this sub daily to flush the old emails from my inbox and deleted items folder.
Every time I got added to a new email chain, I would add that email to the if condition in the code.

To use this code:
Enable the developer ribbon in your Outlook toolbar (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45)
Create a new macro, and paste the txt file into the code editor, be sure to replace the sender and subject with what you wish to be deleted.
Assign a signature to the code (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/digitally-sign-your-macro-project-956e9cc8-bbf6-4365-8bfa-98505ecd1c01).
